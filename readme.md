# modular-domain-adaptation

This is a framework to train and evaluate models using modular adaptation techniques as proposed in the paper Modular Domain Adaptation (TODO add link).

Using this framework, the model producer trains models using anticipatory domain adaptation techniques, and the model consumer uses the same techniques when evaluating and predicting with the model on a new domain, to address the domain misalignment issue without the need of releasing the training data. Please see the paper for further details.

## Installation

Use [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/modular-domain-adaptation/) with python 3.8+:

```
pip install modular-domain-adaptation
```

## Getting Started

Please see the [demo section](./demo) for usage of the main APIs.
