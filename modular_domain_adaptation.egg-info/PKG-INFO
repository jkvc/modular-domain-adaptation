# modular-domain-adaptation

This is a framework to train and evaluate models using modular adaptation techniques as proposed in the paper Modular Domain Adaptation (TODO add link).

<img src="paradigm-diagram.png" width="500" align='center'>

Using this framework, the model producer trains models using anticipatory domain adaptation techniques, and the model consumer uses the same techniques when evaluating and predicting with the model on a new domain, to address the domain misalignment issue without the need of releasing the training data. Please see the paper for further details.

## Installation

Use [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/modular-domain-adaptation/) with python 3.8+:

```
pip install modular-domain-adaptation
```

## Getting Started

Please see the [demo section](./demo) for usage of the main APIs.
